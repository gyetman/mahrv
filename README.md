# MAHRV
The code on this page are for estimating population in Mangrove villages in West Africa and were developed under the project "Estimating and mapping populations in off-grid and hard-to-reach places" and use crowd-sourced village population data along with other covariates. 

Two models were used for the estimation: a linear model and Random Forest Tree.

 You can view the Jupyter Notebooks by clicking on the appropriate files directly in GitHub: [Linear Model v2.ipynb](https://github.com/gyetman/mahrv/blob/master/Linear%20Model%20v2.ipynb) and [Random Forest SLE.ipynb](https://github.com/gyetman/mahrv/blob/master/Random%20Forest%20SLE.ipynb).

The results are visualized as a map in a [public viewer](https://columbia.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Styler/index.html?appid=30edc5325b8545f386ba9193a74d0ec1).
